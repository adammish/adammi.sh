      As a coder I have mostly worked as a
      <a href="/code/freelance">freelancer</a> with a few full time jobs
      sprinkled in. I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript work, particularly on
      the frontend. I also work with Go on the backend.

    <p>As a saxophonist I play throughout the Bay Area.</p>

      Outside of work I love to travel, wander around new places, and watch/play
      soccer. I'm getting married this year!
