      For the past <span class="font-bold">6 years</span> I've been pursuing a
      career in software engineering, blending mostly freelance projects with a
      couple full-time roles. My expertise lies in front-end development,
      primarily with <span class="font-bold">JavaScript/TypeScript</span> and
      frameworks like <span class="font-bold">Vue</span> and
      <span class="font-bold">React</span>. I also have experience on the
      back-end with <span class="font-bold">Node</span> and
      <span class="font-bold">Go</span>.

        I'm open to remote, hybrid, and in-person teams.

        Outside of coding I also freelance as a saxophonist around the Bay Area.

          "Adam is a radically accountable software engineer with the soft and
          organizational skills of a high-performing product manager. At Yardzen
          I have seen him repeatedly take ill-defined project requirements and
          turn them into high-quality software focused on the needs of its
          users.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Adam is excellent at leading teams with agile workflows in a way that
          the right things get done in the proper order and on an ideal
          timeline. He thoroughly understands the value of whatever's being
          built and effectively prioritizes tasks by effort and effect. As a
          senior engineer, I could not think of a team he would not thrive in.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Adam is also an excellent saxophone player, which I hear is a major
          factor in engineering candidate selection these days."
